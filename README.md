It is commonly thought that representation of minorities among mentors helps addressing underepresentation of minorities in the sciences. 
While this is a very reasonable assumption, it is not quantified in the literature, to my knowledge. One way to test this is to measure whether minorities thent to publish together. 
This code is designed to quantify the clustering of femal authorship: if a woman is one of the main authors of a paper, are other women more likely to be among the first authors?

This code was created within AAS2015 hackday.

As of Jan 2015, it is very much a work in progress.
